				<!-- <p>Second generation blockchains have introduced smart contracts that allow for much more complex and conditioned transactions. With smart contracts, participating parties can define transactions via specific on and off-chain parameters.</p>
				<p>However, blockchains alone cannot access this required off-chain data. We use the term <strong>oracle</strong> to define a service that provides off-chain data to on-chain smart contracts.</p>
				<p>Put simply, an oracle acts as a bridge between the real world and blockchain by providing trusted and reliable off-chain data streams.</p> -->
